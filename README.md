# Liver_Disease_Prediction_Using-_Classification_Algorithms
#The liver is an exocrine gland responsible primarily for the detoxification of blood, synthesis of proteins and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. 
#Liver disease is very tricky to diagnose at an early stage based on its symptoms. Fatty Liver Disease which occurs due to fat build up in the liver, is also one of the major liver diseases .
#It  is a very prevalent disease accounting for more than 10 Million cases per year in India. It usually causes no symptoms and needs test to determine if a person is  suffering from disease. The most specific way to diagnose liver disease is by liver function test. 
#With the help of the  detection of the enzyme level we can identify and confirm the presence of liver disease. Machine learning algorithms can be used to classify whether liver disease is present or not based on the set of patient parameters. 
#This research proposes the use of Decision Tree Algorithm, Random Forest Algorithm and Support Vector Machine to perform the classification and the results are compared based on Accuracy and Error calculation.
